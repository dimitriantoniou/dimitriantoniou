### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Dimitri - I'm a Boston native turned Texas transplant. After an undergrad degree in Urban Studies, I went through a 2 year fellowship in entrepreneurship called Venture for America. I moved to San Antonio to join Codeup, a local career accelerator. Since then, I've become a fixer and builder, working on operations and admissions, building a data science program, leading program delivery, launching a Dallas campus, and overseeing programs and partnerships.

Being surrounded by brilliant developers and data scientists exposed me to a lot of cool tech, and I've since become a hobby programmer. Now, I start every day with 30 minutes of programming to wake up my brain. I hope to leverage these technical skills to build my own companies, products, and solutions.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning MySQL and Java to flesh out my basic full-stack knowledge <br>
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Java program to automate class calendar creation for bootcamps and vocational training programs<br>
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about tech and entrepreneurship, workforce development, career accelerators<br>
ðŸ“« How to reach me: I'd love to connect on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/dimitri-m-antoniou/<br>
